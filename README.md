# [Project 1: Life Expectancy and Happiness Indicators in Python](https://github.com/linzheng1009/Life-Expectancy-and-Happiness-Indicators)
* Made predictions about life expectancy of a person based on the Happiness Indicators using some ML algorithms.
* Pre-processed multiple data sets retrieved from Kaggle using Pandas and NumPy.
* Presented descriptive statistics with improved visuals using SweetViz visualyzer.
* Performed visualisations and EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* Performed predictions using 5 ML models with Scikit learn.

# Project 2: Employee Attrition Analysis with R Shiny Web App
* Created an interactive dashboard using IBM employee data set from Kaggle.
* Guided by experienced Business Analyst to refrain from hard-coding.
* Made reactive visualisations that react upon input changes.
* Ensured simple yet visually pleasing UI for users' ease of navigating through the dashboard.

# Project 3: Predictions on Life Expectancy in R
* Similar to Project 1 except that it was done in R with different ML algorithms used on a smaller data set.
* Followed the data science workflow, CRISP-DM for the completion of the project.
* Used RapidMiner in addition to R's ML packages to perform quick ML modelling on the data set.
