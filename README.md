# [Project 1: Life Expectancy and Happiness Indicators in Python](https://github.com/linzheng1009/Life-Expectancy-and-Happiness-Indicators)
* Made predictions about life expectancy of a person based on the Happiness Indicators using some ML algorithms.
* Pre-processed multiple data sets retrieved from Kaggle using Pandas and NumPy.
* Presented descriptive statistics with improved visuals using SweetViz visualyzer.
* Performed visualisations and EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
* Performed predictions using 5 ML models with Scikit learn.

# [Project 2: Employee Attrition Analysis with R Shiny Web App](https://github.com/linzheng1009/Employee-Attrition)
* Created an interactive dashboard using IBM employee data set from Kaggle.
* Guided by experienced Business Analyst to refrain from hard-coding.
* Made reactive visualisations that react upon input changes.
* Ensured simple yet visually pleasing UI for users' ease of navigating through the dashboard.

# [Project 3: Predictions on Life Expectancy in R](https://github.com/linzheng1009/Predictions-on-Life-Expectancy)
* Similar to Project 1 except that it was done in R with different ML algorithms used on a smaller data set.
* Followed the data science workflow, CRISP-DM for the completion of the project.
* Used RapidMiner in addition to R's ML packages to perform quick ML modelling on the data set.

# Project 4: Revenue Analytics for a F&B Firm
* Participated in a small-scaled "Data Challenge" hosted by a Singaporean training academy.
* Participants were given actual F&B data set to derive meaningful insights to be presented to the panel of judges by the end of September 2022.
* Pre-processed the enterprise data set with Python using Pandas and Numpy.
* Performed EDA on the enterprise data set using Tableau.
* Considering the practicality if real value can be generated from leveraging ML on these data.
